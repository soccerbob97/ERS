I started the project during Summer 2020 when Covid started and my internship was canceled. I made a lot of progress that summer such as creating a playable ERS game, creating a custom lobby, and designing the backgrounds. However, when school started in the fall, I was not able to consistently work on the app because it was my first semester at college. I was able to work on my app consistently during spring 2021, and I created custom matchmaking, the shop with animations and cards, and achievements and leaderboards through Google Play. During summer 2021, I implemented unit testing with unity and created many test cases for my app, and Jonathan and I made a music theme for each background. I also redesigned the code for the game because it was inefficient. For fall 2021, I had to change where I stored usersâ€™ data because my original database service stopped working. I decided to use Google Firebase, so I reimplemented user sign-in and methods to store data. In 2022, I created all the user items the user can purchase and created all the UIs for the screens. In 2023, I am changing the multiplayer system because Photon Server has completety updated their approach. 

In summary, our app contains custom match-matching in which the user can play ranked or unranked games, custom lobbies so users can play with friends, and a shop with items the user can buy. I use Unity to build the app, Google Firebase to store user data, Google Play Games to sign the user in and add achievements and leaderboards, and the Photon Server to host the games. 

Ultimately, this is a passion project, and I hope I will finish it one day.

The code is too big to store on Github. Here is some videos to display the progress.
